# 	143 is the snapshot number - it starts counting from the largest snapshot number available on storage.
# 	ab24f033 is a truncated SHA256 hash of the contents of the file (for integrity checking and duplicate identification)

# 	2015.02.01-15.43.22 is a timestamp indicating when this snapshot was taken (according to the clock at the time.
# 		Thanks to the vagaries of Raspberry Pis and generally systems that havenâ€™t seen the internet in a while,
# 		this timestamp is highly unreliable)
